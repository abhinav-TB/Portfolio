It simply means it combines the power of react ,GraphQL ,web pack and other front end tools to offer a great developer Experience\n\n\n## Github Pages\nGitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and easily published through GitHub.Any static site can be published using gh-pages.You can know more about them [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)\n\nThe prerequsite that you need for doing this is you are git and nodejs (which you should already have installed  as you are using it for gatsby) installed on your system.You should also have a github account and a repository to store your code and host it. you can read more about creating a github repository [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)\n\nThe first step should be to install github CLI ,it can be easily done using an npm command `npm install gh-pages --save-dev`\n\nThe second step should be to add the following to gatsby-config.js file,here `reponame`  is the name of your github repo\n\n        module.exports = {\n      pathPrefix: \"/reponame\",\n    }\n\nThe third step is to add the the following to your package.json file\n\n     {\n      \"scripts\": {\n           \"deploy\": \"gatsby build --prefix-paths && gh-pages -d public\"\n       }\n    }\n Now  you are ready to deploy your app to github .You can do that with `npm run deploy`  \n \nThe deploy script we wrote creates a build of our app and then publish it to github. If we navigate to the github repository we have created and refresh the page ,we can see two branches ,the master branch and gh-pages branch .The master branch will have all the code we wrote during development and the gh-pages branch contains our production build . This build is now published via github pages. You can go to the settings and scroll down till you see the github pages title where you can find the url to your site\n","category":"gatsby","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"src":"/static/290e8df00fc481ecd2e250c02ebead5c/0e6e2/81010d592962ae3501ae0e7bfb392601.png"}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}}
